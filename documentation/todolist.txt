start working on build part of CI
the image centos brought a python version 3.6, I was unable to bypass this default version for another
the solution should be to create an image with the proper version and run a personalized gitlab-runner

  stage: build
  script:
    - set -x

issue the rpm is build but not find to be send to gitlab artefacts part 

06/10/2023
fix issue sending artefacts the triggered folder was not the good one
- cp -R ~/rpmbuild $CI_PROJECT_DIR/
The problem is your rpmbuild folder is not under "$CI_PROJECT_DIR" rather it is in the "home" directory of the Gitlab runner.
"~"(home directory) != $CI_PROJECT_DIR(gitlab project directory).

## TODO add others aliases
